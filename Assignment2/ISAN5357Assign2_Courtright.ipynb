    "Description: Simulates n number of scenarios where demmand of a product falls between x and y, where x is min demand and y is max demand. For each scenario, calculate the profit based on the break even formula. User can freely imput the values for n, x, and y along with the product name, the fixed cost of the product, the selling price, and the unit cost. Program will also generate a risk percentage based on how many scenarios produced net positive profit."
