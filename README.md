Submissions from Texas State's ISAN 5357 (Computing for Data Analytics, Graduate Level) course.

Projects are purely for educational purposes. Insights and observations may be incomplete or incorrect. This repository was created as a public way to display my development in analytics programming!

Programs are written in Python, within Jupyter Notebooks for documentation purposes.

All notebooks contain a direct link to the source data (if applicable).

Each Assignment folder has a dedicated README with information about that assignment's data sources and the general concepts explored in the assignment.

Assignment 1: Creating simple programs for banking, interest calculation, and hotel guest check-in (very simple!!)
Assignment 2: Break-even profit simulation based on user-inputted cost and revenue parameters
